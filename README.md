# automotive-trends-and-efficiency-analysis
Data Science project based in Python offering some analysis and visualization of vehicle emission data from 1984 to 2022.


The data used is sourced from https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/ws/ under the U.S Department of Energy.


This dataset consists of 44,460 entries with 83 columns of model specific vehicle data by year (1984 - 2022). There are many interesting facets of this dataset. However, what I currently have accomplished makes use of the following data:

  - Make, model and year
  - Engine size
  - Transmission type
  - Estimated fuel consumption (city, highway and combined)
  - Estimated CO2 emissions (g/mi)
  - Vehicle class (car, truck, van, SUV etc)

The libraries used in this project include: numpy, pandas, and plotly.
